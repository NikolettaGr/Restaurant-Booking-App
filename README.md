## FEATURES

- ### Responsivity
 
 The application is responsive on all device sizes, thanks to the Boostrap theme. In mobile view there is a collapsible menu icon. All images, text labels, forms get appropriately resized. There is an exception, however: when bookings are displayed in the database table in the view_booking.html, on mobile phone screens in portrait mode there is not enough room for all columns to be shown. However, Bootstrap adds a slide bar so that user can slide the page content from left to right.

- ### Interactive elements
  -   #### Nav links for Home, Menu, Contact, Book a table, My bookings, Login and Logout pages
  -   #### Form input fields on signup, register, signout, table booking and edit booking
  -   #### Buttons - including form buttons (signup, register, signout, table booking, edit booking and delete booking form buttons) and page buttons (Book a table button on Home page)


- ### Features to add in future   

* In-Depth Restaurant Information

- Enhance the restaurant profiles with detailed information such as photos, menus, chef profiles, and virtual tours. Provide users with a comprehensive overview to help them make informed dining choices.
  

* Integration with Food Delivery

- Integrate food delivery services to allow users to seamlessly switch between booking a table and ordering takeout or delivery from the same restaurant. Provide a one-stop solution for all dining needs.


* Review and Rating System

- Enhance the user experience by adding a review and rating system. Encourage users to share their dining experiences and provide valuable feedback to restaurants.


* Multi-Language Support

- Expand your user base by offering the website in multiple languages to cater to a diverse clientele.
